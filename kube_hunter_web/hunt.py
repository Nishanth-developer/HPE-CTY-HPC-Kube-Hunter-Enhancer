    "khv002":"The vulnerability (khv002) is related to the fact that your Kubernetes cluster's version is publicly available, making it easier for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities. To fix this issue, you need to disable the --enable-debugging-handlers flag in kubelet.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\nSSH into the node where kubelet is running\nOpen the kubelet configuration file located at /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf\nAdd --enable-debugging-handlers=false to the KUBELET_ARGS variable\nSave and close the file\nRestart the kubelet process using the command sudo systemctl restart kubelet\nBy following these steps, you will successfully disable the --enable-debugging-handlers flag in kubelet, which will prevent attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes cluster's specific version",
    "khv003":"Check if your AKS cluster is running on or after the 2020.10.15 Azure VHD Release. You can check this by running the following command:\n\naz aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --query agentPoolProfiles[0].imageVersion\n\nThis will return the image version of the agent pool used in the cluster.\n\nIf the image version is on or after 2020.10.15, then the pod CIDR access to the internal HTTP endpoint is already restricted by default and no further action is needed.\n\nIf the image version is before 2020.10.15, then you need to update your AKS cluster to at least that version. You can do this by running the following commands:\n\naz aks upgrade \\\n    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \\\n    --name <cluster-name> \\\n    --kubernetes-version <version>\nReplace <version> with a version equal to or greater than 1.18.14.\n\nOnce the AKS cluster is updated, pod CIDR access to the internal HTTP endpoint is automatically restricted.\n\nBy following these steps, you will mitigate vulnerability khv003 by restricting pod CIDR access to the internal HTTP endpoint in an AKS cluster.",
    "khv004":"Steps you can follow to fix vulnerability khv004:\n\nUpdate or rotate the cluster SPN (Service Principal Name) credentials frequently to avoid leaked credentials persisting over time. Refer to https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/aks/update-credentials.md for more details.\n\nConsider using Azure Managed Identities instead of a static SPN. However, this functionality is not yet mature and is currently available in alpha stage only for aks-engine (non-managed Kubernetes). Refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview for more details.\n\nIf you are relying on a shared file on the node that contains credentials to the Azure API under /etc/kubernetes/azure.json, you need to ensure that access to this file is protected by appropriate file permissions so that unauthorized pod cannot read this file.\n\nBy following these steps, you will mitigate vulnerability khv004 by updating or rotating the cluster SPN credentials and protecting the shared file containing those credentials.",
    "khv005":"Steps you can follow to fix vulnerability khv005:\n\nExplicitly specify a Service Account for all of your workloads by setting the serviceAccountName field in Pod.Spec. This ensures that each workload has its own Service Account, which can be managed independently and with the least privilege principle in mind. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/ for more details.\n\nConsider opting out automatic mounting of the Service Account token using automountServiceAccountToken: false on ServiceAccount resource or Pod.spec. By default, Kubernetes automatically mounts Service Account tokens into pods, but if the tokens are not needed, it is better to disable this feature to reduce the attack surface. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#disable-automatic-mounting-of-the-serviceaccount-token for more details.\n\nReview the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions for the Service Accounts used by your workloads, and ensure that they have only the necessary permissions required to perform their tasks. You can do this by running the following command:\n\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.serviceAccountName}'\nReplace <pod-name> with the name of the pod whose Service Account you want to check.\n\nBy following these steps, you will mitigate vulnerability khv005 by securing access to your Kubernetes API through the use of Service Accounts and RBAC permissions, and reducing the attack surface by disabling automatic mounting of Service Account tokens when they are not needed.",
    "khv006":"Steps you can follow to fix vulnerability khv006:\n\nEnsure your setup is exposing kube-api only on an HTTPS port. This can be done by setting the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file flags when starting the kube-apiserver process. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/ for more details.\n\nDo not enable kube-api's --insecure-port flag in production. This flag allows the API server to listen on an insecure port (HTTP) in addition to the secure port (HTTPS). It should be used only for testing purposes during development, as it poses a significant security risk in production. If it is enabled, make sure that it is disabled immediately.\n\nBy following these steps, you will mitigate vulnerability khv006 by ensuring that your setup exposes kube-api only on an HTTPS port and disabling the use of the --insecure-port flag.",
    "khv007":"Steps you can follow to fix vulnerability khv007:\n\nReview the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions for the anonymous and default Service Accounts used by your workloads. The anonymous Service Account is used when no Service Account is explicitly specified in a Pod's serviceAccountName field, while the default Service Account is created automatically when a namespace is created. Both of these Service Accounts have access to the Kubernetes API server by default, so it is important to review their permissions and ensure that they only have the necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.\n\nUse the kubectl auth can-i command to test the permissions of the anonymous and default Service Accounts. For example, to test whether the anonymous Service Account has permission to create pods, run the following command:\n\nkubectl auth can-i create pods --as system:anonymous\nIf the command returns yes, then the anonymous Service Account has permission to create pods, which may be too permissive for your security requirements.\n\nConsider creating custom Service Accounts with limited RBAC permissions tailored to the specific needs of your workloads, and use them instead of the anonymous or default Service Accounts. This allows you to manage their permissions according to the least privilege principle and reduce the attack surface.\n\nBy following these steps, you will mitigate vulnerability khv007 by reviewing and managing the RBAC permissions for the anonymous and default Service Accounts used by your workloads, and creating custom Service Accounts with limited permissions tailored to the specific needs of your workloads.",
    "khv020":"Sure, here are the steps you can follow to fix vulnerability khv020:\n\nReview the securityContext of your pods and check whether the NET_RAW capability is enabled. This capability allows low-level network access to pods and can be abused to perform ARP spoofing attacks.\n\nConsider dropping the NET_RAW capability from your pods using Pod.spec.securityContext.capabilities. This removes the ability for pods to perform low-level network interactions that could be used for malicious purposes. To drop the NET_RAW capability, add the following lines to your pod specification:\n\nspec:\n  securityContext:\n    capabilities:\n      drop:\n      - NET_RAW\nIf you still require this capability for specific use cases, consider setting up an additional layer of protection such as network policies or a service mesh to restrict access and mitigate potential risks.\n\nBy following these steps, you will mitigate vulnerability khv020 by dropping the NET_RAW capability from your pods and removing the ability for them to perform low-level network interactions that could be used for ARP spoofing attacks.",

    "khv047":"Sure, here are the steps you can follow to fix vulnerability khv047:\n\nConsider disallowing running as root by using Kubernetes Pod Security Policies with MustRunAsNonRoot policy. This will prevent containers in the pod from having write access to the host's /var/log directory.\n\nConsider disallowing writable host mounts to /var/log by using Kubernetes Pod Security Policies with AllowedHostPaths policy. This will prevent containers in the pod from being able to create arbitrary files or symlink to other files on the host.\n\nUse a container runtime like Aqua that provides additional security controls for Kubernetes clusters. For example, Aqua has a Runtime Policy with Volume Blacklist and Blacklisted OS Users and Groups that can further restrict access to sensitive directories such as /var/log.\n\nBy following these steps, you will mitigate vulnerability khv047 by disallowing running as root, disallowing writable host mounts to /var/log, and using a container runtime that provides additional security controls for Kubernetes clusters.
