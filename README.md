# Enhanced logging and metrics exporter for Kube-Hunter

Kube Hunter is a security tool developed by Aqua security team to detect threats in the cluster. It provides us with a wide range of scanning options and serves as one of the best security tool available in the market for kubernetes security. However the log file provided by the tool as a results is very simple and contains very little information.

A sample log file generated by Kube Hunter in a newly created kubernetes cluster in minikube:

This requires the user to get the ID from the log file (eg.KHV002) and search that ID in the official Kube Hunter website and get information about the threat.

eg. To know more information about the vulnerability ID khv002, then after searching the ID in the webpage https://aquasecurity.github.io/kube-hunter/ we get this below page rendered.

Also it is clear that, there is no remediation on how to resolve a particular threat found in the cluster as they are only providing the reference links.

Hence my project focusses on generating a precise threat report which contains all the necessary information about the threats found in the cluster along with the remediation on how to resolve them, a clean dashboard to view those and also a metrics export option to view those metrics in dashboards like grafana.
